# cmudict-converter
Converts the Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary (CMUdict) file to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and to an easier to read spelling approximation. Fills a MYSQL database with the output if desired.

Currently, this program just outputs strings with no syllable breaks. I've tried putting them in, but the number of rules and exceptions to these rules is difficult to deal with. If anybody cares to help out with this, Id be greatful.
