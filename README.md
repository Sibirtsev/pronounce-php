# Pronounce-PHP
Converts words to pronunciation strings using the Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary (CMUdict) file.  Currently converts to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and to an easier to read spelling approximation.

Currently, this program just outputs strings to the console with no syllable breaks. Syllables and database filling capabilities are coming soon.
